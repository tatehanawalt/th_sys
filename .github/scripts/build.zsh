# TLDR:
#
# Call this script with 1 argument - the build version.
#
# Each project has a script that packages the project into a tar archive.
#
# This file (th_shs/bin/build.zsh) calls each project's archive packager
# script (or binary executable) to build the projects archive
#
# ARGS passed to each projects archive packager script:
#
#   $1: Full path to the project (unique to the specific project)
#   $2: Directory where the project archiive pacckager placces the
#       archive on success (same for every project)
#   $3: The Build Version  (same for every project)
#
# Archive packagers exit with code 0 on successful
# Any exit code that is NOT a 0 indicates an failure or error of some kind
# This script exits immedietly if any project archive packager fails
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Overview:
# Projects are packaged for distribution as .tar.gz archives. Each project
# contains a script (or binary executable) responsible for packaging that
# projects distribution archive.
#
# The th_sys/bin/build.zsh script:
#
#   • Determines the build output directory
#   • Removes any existing items from that directory
#   • Determins which projects need to be packaged
#   • Exits immedietly after any project archive packager fails
#   • Calls project archive packagers sequentially (for the time being)
#   • does NOT validate format of returned archives
#   • Does verify a project archive packager that exited succesfully delivered
#     resulted in a file located at full path <out_path>/<package_name>.tar.gz
#   • Call project archive packager with arguments ordered and formatted
#     the same as every other packager
#
# Every project's archive packager (script or binary executable) is expected to:
#
#   • Be located at <repo_path>/<project_name>/bin/pack_archive
#   • Indicate success by existing with exit code 0
#   • Indicate Errors/Failures by exiting with an exit code that is not 0
#   • Handle arguments in the same order & format as all other
#     project archive packages
#
# Packager Arguments:
#
#   1. full path of the project (including the project name)
#   2. full-path of the output directory
#   3. The build version
#
# IF SUCCESSFUL: the demoassembly packager is expected to place a 'demoassembly.tar.gz' in the
#                build output directory (Arg 2)

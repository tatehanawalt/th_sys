## Overview ##

Each project is a single project which can be built/compiled to a single binary (or java byte code) and installed/run with brew

<br>

#### Project Criteria: ####

<br>

**Projects must have root level directories:**

  - `bin`

    - `build` - Executable file (described below) which builds the project to a tar file <name>.tar.gz

  - `doc`

    - `man`

      - `<project_name>.1` - Man 1 Page file for the project

#### Specific Project Files: ####

**`bin/build`** - Builds project binary or java byte code

**Params:**

  1. Project Path: `<path/to/this/repo>/<project>`

  2. Destination path: A directory where the build script must build the project to

  3. Build Version: Semver

**Exit Codes:**

  - **0**: Successfully packaged project to the destination path

  - **1**: Input error (invalid param count, format, or any input/context related issues)

  - **2**: Failed to build project for any other reason

<br>

**Build a project**

  1. `cd` to the root directory of one of the projects - `<path/to/repo>/<project`

  2. Create a directory where the project will build. try `<path/to/repo>/out` with `mkdir out`

  3. Run Build Command `./bin/build $(pwd) $(pwd)/out 0.0.0`
